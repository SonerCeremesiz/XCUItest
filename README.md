# XCUITest Sample App

![TestingBot logo](resources/testingbot-logo.png?raw=true "Logo")

This is a simple sample iOS app designed to demonstrate how to perform UI testing using [XCUITest](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/09-ui_testing.html).

The app provides two input fields for entering numbers. When you tap the **Calculate** button, the result field will display the sum of the two numbers.

The project includes a sample XCUITest that automates these steps and verifies the result.
